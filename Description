I analyzed the relationship between economic metrics and health outcomes across countries using datasets from the World Bank and United Nations. My goal was to examine how healthcare spending and GDP per capita influence life expectancy and other health indicators, providing valuable insights for policy-making.  
To achieve this, I gathered data through public APIs and web scraping, then cleaned, merged, and standardized it using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy. This preprocessing ensured consistency and accuracy in the analysis. Using statistical methods, I identified correlations between healthcare investments and economic growth, highlighting key trends across different nations.
To visualize these relationships effectively, I utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn, creating heatmaps and scatter plots that illustrated patterns clearly. These visualizations helped uncover how economic development impacts health outcomes, making complex data more accessible.
Finally, I documented the findings in Jupyter Notebooks, ensuring a structured and easily interpretable format. The analysis provided data-backed recommendations, offering insights that could inform healthcare policies and economic strategies.
